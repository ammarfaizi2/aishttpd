Subject: Introducing aishttpd

Hello,

This is the aishttpd project. The naming "AIS" comes from my initials,
Alviro Iskandar Setiawan. aishttpd is a simple HTTP server written in C.
I started this project on Sunday, December 21, 2025. The main goal of
this project is to warm up my socket programming skills.

On December 21, 2025, I met Misa on a newly created IRC channel. After a
brief conversation, Misa showed me a small HTTP server project written
in C++. The discussion with Misa inspired me to create my own HTTP
server in C/C++ too.

Recall that I am currently heavily working on socket programming on
Linux. So writing my own HTTP server is very relevant to my current
exploration path.  Doing it as a hobby in my free time is fun.

aishttpd is still in its very early stage. Currently, it only returns an
"HTTP 200 OK" response with a "Hello, World!" plain-text body for every
incoming HTTP request. More features will be added in the future.

Note that my focus right now is on the socket programming aspect. So I
might not implement the HTTP parser myself. Instead, I will consider the
picohttpparser library by the h2o project as the HTTP parser component:

        https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser

I plan to plug picohttpparser into aishttpd to handle HTTP parsing. This
way, I can focus more on socket programming.

Currently, aishttpd can handle multiple clients using the epoll syscall
on Linux. I plan to add more features in the future, such as serving
static files, logging, and support for configuration files.

Once the project matures enough, I will start adding support for
keep-alive, chunked transfer encoding, and other HTTP/1.1 features.

Also, adding io_uring support is on my radar ;-)

Currently, this project has almost no dependencies. It only depends on
the standard C library and Linux syscalls. If you want to try it out,
you can do the following:

        git clone https://github.com/alviroiskandar/aishttpd.git;
        cd aishttpd;
        make -j$(nproc);
        ./aishttpd;

Then you can open your web browser and navigate to:

        http://localhost:9980

Or just use curl.

I hope you find this project interesting. Feel free to reach out to me
if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for your attention!

Best regards,
